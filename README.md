[Link to Weekly Progress](https://rainy-bandana-838.notion.site/Weekly-Progress-131efb4f82c8809d972df057fff5b289?pvs=4)

## Rules
- Solve two designated LeetCode problems each week.
- Language is up to the participantâ€™s choice.

### Workflow
1. Create a `Branch` with your name (ex. dayeon), upload your code, and submit a `Pull Request`.
2. Other members review the code with `Comments`.
3. The last reviewer approves the code and performs the `Merge`.
4. During the meeting, each member explains their approach to solving the problem.

## Conventions

### Comments
- Include comments that document the thought process, idea formulation, and concept application in your code.

### File Naming

- **Separators between components**: Use `-` (hyphen).
- **Spaces within components**: Use `_` (underscore).
